Description

We're going to compute the technical debt for Ubuntu packages. Steps may be:

    Finding the most likely upstream commit for a Ubuntu package.

    Having a script for, given the name of a Ubuntu package, and the url for the git repo of its upstream, find its most likely commit upstream:

diff_ubuntu gnome-tomboy http://url_tomboy_git_repo

would produce the hash and date of the most likely commit upstream

This can be done for a start for a specific Ubuntu release, such as 15.04.

    Having a script doing the same, for versions of the package in several Ubuntu releeases (14.04, 14.10, 15.04, 15.10)

The result will be the most likely upstream commit for each of the packages.

    Doing the same for a subset of an entire Ubuntu distro.

For this, we would need something like a configuration file for the packages, stating the corresponding upstream repos for each package. Something like:

[{pkg_name: gnome-tomboy,
url_repo: http://url_upstream_git_repo
}, .... ]

    Actually estimating technical debt for all those packages, as a diff in lines and commits.
