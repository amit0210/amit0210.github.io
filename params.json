  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nI was born and raised in India. I have always been passionate about computers and software in general and its execution always curious me when i was a kid and this is how I start my path towards Computer Science  and so I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I did Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from India and Master of Science in Information Technology (Specialization: Software ) from Germany.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am doing my hard job as a  Researcher (Marie - Curie Research Fellow)  in Spain. I do research in  things which currently most interesting  for me : fist- Technical debt and Second: Code Smell  and Bad process smell in software development / Software Management \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
